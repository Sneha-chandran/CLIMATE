    <h1>CLIMATE CHANGE</h1>
    <p>Geographically Kerala is the land of mountains and valleys, evergreen forests cascading waterfalls and palm ringed lagoons Innumerable rivers and river lets criss crossing the countryside towards the west to reach the Arabian Sea. The western ghat on one side and the Arabian Sea on the other side effectively create a unique climatic condition from rest of the country. The wind system in the adjoining Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea is subject to periodical reversal and controls the day to day weather of our state. The Western Ghats influence the weather very much. The forced ascent of monsoon currents gives rise to heavy rainfall on the windward side of the region. The intensity of the rain is dependent not only on the altitude, but also on the strength and direction of the current as well as the steepness of the slope and other characteristics.
